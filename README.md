# nearBest
Do you want to know the best places around? We'll show you

## App Description

This app was developed as part of the [Altran's](https://www.altran.com/pt/pt-pt/) selection process. It consists of a two-screen app that gathers data from the [Google Places API](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/intro) and shows you the best rated places around you.

The first screen gives you a list of Categories (Favorites, Restaurants, Shopping Malls, Museums and Hospitals) to choose from. The second screen will give you a list of places from the selected category, showing you the name, rating and the total count of ratings for each place.

### Best Place
The best place for each category is shown differently from the others. Please, take a look at this example:
